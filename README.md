# Botpub

This is hangout for my ActivityPub bots

## TODO

* Implement periodic timer function (e.g. to compliment / insult random follower)

* Handle generating and linking to images

* Start using a real JSON-LD library

* Replace GET /outbox with S3 resource rather than function

* Figure out some way to make Webfinger static and drop the function

* Better HTML views for better browser experience

* Accept commands from owner to remote-control the bot

* Get everything working on serverless Google Cloud

* Get everything working on Glitch & Firebase?
