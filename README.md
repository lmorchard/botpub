# Botpub

This is hangout for my ActivityPub bots

## TODO

* Split out bot behavior into its own module

* Start using a real JSON-LD library

* Replace GET /outbox with S3 resource rather than function

* Better HTML views of various things for better browser experience

* Periodically insult followers

* Accept commands from owner to remote-control the bot
