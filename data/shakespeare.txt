# Shakespeare Insult Kit
#
# Since 1996, the origin of this kit was listed as anonymous. It came to me on a
# piece of paper in the 90's with no attribution, and I thought it would make a
# cool web page. Though I searched for the origin, I could never find it. In
# 2014, Lara M found the originating author. An English teacher at Center Grove
# High School in Greenwood Indiana named Jerry Maguire appears to be the
# originating author.
